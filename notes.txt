the box model:

Is the model in charge of manipulating element size, padding, border and margins. It also allows you to set background colors.

*******************
CSS Display:

It is composed of the following values:

POSITION: This allows you to position elements as Static, fixed, relative and absolute.

DISPLAY: This allows you to convert block elements into inline elements, for example: h1 elements by default are block elements, taking all space to the left and right of them. You can convert h1 to inline element by applying an "inline" value to the "display" property. Ex: h1 {display: inline;}. Keep in mind, width is not a property that can be set for inline elements.
Another value for Display property is inline-block. What this will do, is to allow block elements to be converted to inline elements and width and height values can be set for these elements.

z-index: This allows to set how far back or forward overlapping elements will be displayed.
